### TLDR; I'm a huge advocate of unit tests, but this repo is mostly a playground - so no unit tests for now.


Oh hi, wasn't expecting to see someone here. Well, uhm, that's embarrasing. You showing up here, 
hoping to find some great test cases. Being all excited about seeing 100% test coverage. Oh, wow, 
that's really awkward.

Truth is, I love tests, I really do. I would not want
to work on a project (that's ever supposed to go into production) without unit tests, even more so when I 
work with others on the code base. If you tell me in my pull request that my tests suck, I am dedicated to
improving them. But I am being pragmatic with this repository, and since this serves more as a playground
(call it proof of concept/skills if you want), test coverage is not of high prio.

Thanks, bye.
